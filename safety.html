					  		<p>The Clark County School District is dedicated to promoting the safety, well-being, and success of all students. The goal of providing families with resources about discrimination based on race, bullying, or cyberbullying is to empower students and adults with information to help them understand what discrimination based on race, bullying, or cyberbullying is, who is affected by it, and what can be done to prevent it.</p>
<p>
CCSD is committed to providing a safe, secure, and respectful learning environment for all students and employees in all District facilities and school-sponsored events. CCSD takes a strong stance against discrimination based on race, bullying, or cyberbullying.</p> 
<p>
Under NRS 388.135, “Discrimination based on Race” means any single or repeated or pervasive act or acts, whether targeted to a specific person or targeted in general to any person’s demographic, regarding the race, color, culture, religion, language, ethnicity or national origin of a person that causes harm or creates a hostile work or learning environment, which may include, without limitation, jokes, threats, physical altercations or intimidation; and that occurs in person, online or in any other setting including, without limitation, in a course of distance education. A student who is a “substantiated” victim of bullying, cyberbullying, and/or discrimination based on race may be reassigned to another public school at the parent/guardian’s request.</p>

<p>Under Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 388.122, “bullying” means written, verbal, or electronic expressions or physical acts or gestures, or any combination thereof, that are directed at a person or group of persons, or a single severe and willful act or expression that is directed at a person or group of persons. (See <a href="https://ccsd.net/district/policies-regulations/pdf/5137_P.pdf" target="_blank">CCSD Policy 5137</a> for the full definition of bullying.)</p>

<p>Under NRS 388.123, “cyberbullying” means bullying through the use of electronic communication. The term includes the use of electronic communication to transmit or distribute a sexual image of a minor.</p>

<p>This requirement does not supersede the District’s ability to discipline offenders in accordance with CCSD regulations.</p> 

<p>To report discrimination based on race, bullying, or cyberbullying at your child's school, please contact your school principal/administrator, or visit <a href="http://safevoicenv.org/" target="_blank">safevoicenv.org</a>.</p>

      <div class="accordion-body">
              <p>Students, parents/guardians, and faculty throughout Nevada have access to SafeVoice, an anonymous reporting system used to report threats to the safety or well-being of students. SafeVoice was established by the Nevada Department of Education under Nevada law to protect student wellness, prevent violence, and save lives. (SafeVoice is found in Nevada Revised Statutes 388.1451 to 388.1459.)</p>

<p>In partnership with the Nevada Department of Public Safety, the SafeVoice program provides students with a safe place to submit tips concerning their own safety or that of others. A fully trained professional team of experts responds in an appropriate manner 24/7/365. Tips always stay anonymous.</p> 

<p>SafeVoice reports can be made through the hotline by calling 1-833-216-7233, electronically at <a href="http://safevoicenv.org/" target="_blank">safevoicenv.org</a>, or through a free mobile app available in the app store for either <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.p3tips.safevoice&hl=en_US&pli=1" target="_blank">Android</a> or <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/safevoice-nevada/id1322204906" target="_blank">iPhone</a>.</p>

        GoGuardian (Device Filtering and Monitoring)</button>

    <div id="panelsStayOpen-collapse3" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="panelsStayOpen-heading3">
      <div class="accordion-body">
               <p>To support the Clark County School District’s one-to-one device initiatives and deployments, distance and blended learning, mental health support initiatives, and to comply with the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) E-rate program rules, the Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA), and the Protecting Children in the 21st Century Act, CCSD requires a content filtering, management, theft recovery, alerting, and remote teaching/proctoring solution. CCSD will continue the usage of GoGuardian districtwide for the 2024-2025 school year.</p>

<p>GoGuardian is deployed to the students' nv.ccsd.net user accounts as an extension, and the application functionality will be only enabled when a student is logged into a Chromebook or Chrome browser on any operating system (Mac/PC) with their nv.ccsd.net user account, regardless of whether the device was issued by CCSD or is a personal device.</p>

<p>The GoGuardian Suite is utilized for content filtering and blocking access to harmful or inappropriate websites. GoGuardian also provides class management tools for teachers to help keep students on-task and away from distracting content during instructional time. In addition, GoGuardian Beacon 24/7 provides alerts to CCSD staff 24 hours a day, monitoring online activity that is considered a life-safety issue or threat such as actively planning suicide or self-harm. More information for parents/guardians can be found in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ov_jFoiYtw3c46BALBOLFZouT6mJ03GeON1G2qR5l70/edit#heading=h.jmid5nea5psa" target="_blank">GoGuardian Parent Information document</a>.</p>

<p>Though GoGuardian may provide protection against inappropriate content for students, monitor online activities, and alert for life-safety issues, no filtering or monitoring system is perfect. CCSD cannot and does not represent that inappropriate or objectionable material can be completely filtered and does not guarantee that all life-safety issues will be detected. Parents/Guardians are still responsible for actively monitoring their child(ren).</p>

<p>Additional information on the GoGuardian Suite can be found on <a href="https://stutech.ccsd.net/goguardian/" target="_blank">stutech.ccsd.net</a>.</p>

<p>Parents/Guardians should frequently review the content, including apps, media files, etc., of students’ mobile devices to ensure that they are being used appropriately. If parents/guardians are concerned or have questions regarding the use of the devices, they may contact school staff for clarification.</p>

              <p>CCSD Safe Routes to School (SRTS) program encourages safe walking and bicycling to and from schools. SRTS is based on six principles, the “6 E’s“: Education, Encouragement, Engagement, Engineering, Evaluation, and Equity.</p> 
                                                     
														   <p>SRTS offers free programs to schools K-12 that include, but are not limited to, bike-pedestrian safety clinics, bike repair workshops, student safety assemblies, parent workshops, walk and roll incentive programs, and helmet fittings.</p> 

															<p>SRTS programs are sustained efforts by parents/guardians, schools, community leaders, and local, state, and federal governments to improve the health and well-being of children by enabling and encouraging them to walk and bicycle to school and to do so safely.</p>
