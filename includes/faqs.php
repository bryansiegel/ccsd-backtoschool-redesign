                                        Non-locking, signal-blocking pouches prevent electronic devices from sending or receiving signals while inside the pouch. The primary purpose is to ensure a distraction-free and safe learning environment.

                                        We understand that emergencies will occur. Parents may contact the school’s main office to speak with their child if the need arises. Additionally, when a student removes his/her cell phone from the pouch and the phone regains service it will receive all missed data including texts, emails, voicemails, notifications, and alerts. Students will have access to their cell phones during lunch, nutritional breaks, District sponsored activities, and while riding a school bus.</p>

                                        Exceptions will be addressed on an individual basis considering health and specific needs of a student with disabilities. Students with specific health needs may require the cell phone to be in a non-blocking (bluetooth enabling) pouch near them to transmit a signal to medical devices. Examples include diabetic pumps and continuous glucose monitoring devices.  Students with medical exemptions should have their cell phone on their person in the event of an emergency or evacuation. Parents should contact the school's health office for more information.
